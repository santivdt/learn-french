NextJS try-out project.

An application to 'learn french' but mostly for me to try learn React/NextJS. 
I am not a designer, which is clearly demonstrated in this project. As it evolves I am more and more proud of the code whilst the visual side of it is still hideous. My CSS skills are solid, so when I have a design I can recreate it though. 

The main branch is deploying to Netlify (https://bomen.netlify.app/) - the dev branch shows my most recent work/work in progress.
